<h1>Individuals with Disabilities Education Act</h1>
  <p>The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) (formerly call P.L. 94-142 or the Education for all Handicapped Children Act of 1975) requires public schools to make available to all eligible children with disabilities a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment appropriate to their individual needs. This law has been revised many times over the years. Congress passed the most recent amendments in December 2004, with final regulations published in August 2006.</p>

  <p>Information regarding the new amendments may be found at the US Department of Education's new website;<br>Building the Legacy: IDEA 2004 <a href="http://idea.edu.gov" alt="Building the Legacy: IDEA 2004" title="Building the Legacy: IDEA 2004">http://idea.ed.gov</a></p>

  <p>IDEA requires public school systems to develp appropriate Individualized Education Programs (IEP's) for each child. The specific special education and related services outlined in each IEP reflect the individualized needs of each student.</p>

  <p>IDEA also mandates that particular procedures be followed in the development of the IEP. Each student's IEP must be developed by the team of knowledgeable persons and must be at least reviewed annuall. The team includes the child's teacher; the parents, subject to certain limited exceptions; the child, if determined appropriate; an agency representative who is qualified to provide3 or supervise the provision of special edcation; and other indivias at the parents' or agency's discretion.</p>

  <p>If parents disagree with the proposed IEP, they can request a due process hearing and a review from the State educational ageny if applicable in that state. They also can appeal the State agency's decision to State of Federal court.</p>
