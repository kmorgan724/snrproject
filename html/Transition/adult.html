<h1>When to Start the Tansition Process</h1>
  <p>Most children begin thinking about their ideas and wishes for adulthood while in their early teens. It is no different for a child with disabilities. However. Children who have been involved with Special Education for several years may find the change in focus unsettling. Instead of identifying and working to minimize challenges the IEP team and family members now find themselves working on goals directed toward your child's future after leaving the school system and the IDEA program.</p>

  <p>n most states Transition Services are a coordinated group of activities and services based on the child's needs, abilities, strengths, and interests. The purpose of these activities and services is to prepare your child for life AFTER leaving the IDEA system at age 22.</p>

  <p>The following is intended as a GENERAL guide. Discretion should be used in each individual instance to ensure the proper steps are being made at the right time, in the right place, and in the direction the child wants to go. Don't forget, SELF-DETERMINATION is a major key to the success of the transition period.</p>
