<h1>Housing Basics</h1>
  <p>For most families the biggest, and most important, financial decision they will make will be choosing where to live. There are many factors that must be considered when choosing a home. Cost, own or rent, the location, accessibility to community services, interior features, condition of the home, etc.</p>

  <p>The location of your home is important but more important is the home itself. This is where families spend the majority of their time. Many families find themselves “making do” with homes that do not meet the needs of every family member and, therefore, not meeting the needs of the family as a whole. The majority of homes within budget range for budget strapped families are generally older homes with rooms that are too small, too dark, too low and awkward for furniture and equipment. Newer tract homes have many of the same problems. Small, elevated entrances and a lack of accessible walkways or stairs are another major shortfall in the construction process. Our living spaces are still some of the most difficult spaces to navigate. Finding a cost effective accessible home in today’s market is a very real challenge.</p>

  <p>Currently there is no legislation regulating accessible or universal housing design for single family dwellings. Unfortunately the Fair Housing Act (FHA) http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/housing/housing_coverage.htm only addresses multiple housing units and does nothing to promote the same standards for single family homes. This means the Fair Housing Act only addresses housing provided in apartment complexes, designated group homes and other “public” types of housing. This is not to be confused with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)  http://www.ada.gov/pubs/ada.htm  which was originally designed for public and commercial spaces. Again, nothing is said about single family dwellings. This leaves a lot of room by builders for interpretation.</p>

  <p>Given there is no specific standard for single family home construction most architects, drafters, and builders will reference both the FHA and the ADA for basic standards but these cannot be enforced by municipalities as single family dwellings were not included in either act in their present form. This makes finding a home a big problem for families with disabled family members or who would like to age in place without large remodels later on. As of this writing there are no proposed amendments or legislation addressing single family dwellings in sight.</p>

  <p>There is also the problem of new equipment technology. Mobility aids (wheelchairs, walkers, ceiling lifts, etc.) have changed drastically over the last 20 years, and will continue to do so. The space needed to maneuver the newer equipment varies from individual to individual as most technology is now “custom made” for the individual user.</p>

  <p>Many inroads have been made in recent years to Accessible/Universal home design but there is still a long way to go with regards to truly accessible housing. Current thought among most builders is if a home has a bathroom and kitchen that meets ADA requirements, an exterior ramp and a wide front door, the home must be wheelchair accessible. What has not been taken into consideration is that people with physical disabilities live in other rooms of the house as well.  Even today it is almost impossible to locate a builder or contractor who truly understands Universal Design and the effect it has on the occupants.</p>

  <p>The majority of accessibility issues are generally viewed from the perspectives of a mostly independent adult using a self-propelled manual wheelchair or an elderly individual/couple suffering the effects of old age. Readily available house plans currently on the market are designed specifically for adults or empty nesters with no children. Even less thought has been given to family living. Every family member needs to be able to access every room in the home without difficulty.</p>

<h2>What is Universal Housing?</h2>
  <p><i>Universal design is the design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design.</i> -Ron Mace</p>

  <p>While inroads have been made by the construction industry regarding accessible/universal home design there is still a long way to go before the general public is able to find  truly accessible housing without a great deal of difficulty. Current thought among most builders seems to be if a home has a bathroom and kitchen that meets commercial ADA standards, has an exterior ramp and a wide front door; the home must be wheelchair accessible.</p>
 
  <p>Current home-building trends are turning more toward building homes with at least a few basic accessible features. Many builders are now adding at least one ADA qualified bathroom, ground level entries and a wider entry door. While this is a step in the right direction builders and designers seem to have forgotten that people with disabilities don’t spend all their time in the bathroom or the kitchen. They want to be able to access the rest of the house as well. There are many additional features that can easily be added to new housing plans with minimal cost to the consumer.</p>

<h3>How Do I Know What I Need?</h3>
  <p>If you are unsure of what types of changes will need to be made or equipment you will require, an evaluation by a Rehabilitation specialist trained in housing accessibility may be very helpful in assisting you identify features that could be upgraded. If you are applying for assistance programs for remodeling or updating your current home a Rehabilitation evaluation is an absolute must. An assessment of your current housing situation with a list of limitations and pit falls with recommended changes and upgrades for new housing is key. This letter of recommendations will be the foundation for shopping for new housing, applying for grants, HUD loans, ordering equipment, working with a contractor etc. Your physician may also use this letter as a reference when writing prescriptions for equipment ordered through a medical equipment company, which may also be paid for by your insurance company. Once you know what you need, you can then begin to look at your options.</p>

   <p>Whether you are renting, purchasing existing construction or building a new home from the ground up there are several specific features to be on the look out for.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>An easily accessible, safe, approach to the main entrance. Either a gently sloping sidewalk or ground level porch. Covered and out of the weather is preferred.</li>
      <li>A wide front doorway a minimum of 36 inches wide. Paddle/lever handles are easier to grasp and manipulate.</li>
      <li>Interior doorways and hallways must be navigable. Interior doors should also be 36 inches wide, when possible.</li>
      <li>At least one bathroom must be accessible. A wheelchair turn space and room for a care assistant should be built into the room. Add a curb-less shower, handheld shower head and lower faucet controls for ease of use.</li>
      <li> Kitchens should have the minimum ADA required turn around space and accessible counter tops and cooking surfaces. Lower cabinets and open shelving add to the accessibility of the space. A lower wall oven and a drawer dishwasher will also increase ease of use in the space.</li>
      <li>Bedrooms must have enough room for a bed, dresser and space for any equipment that may be needed by the individual. Allow room for a wheelchair or walker to be placed within reach from the bed. Install an intercom near the bed if needed to call for help during the night.</li>
      <li>Light switches and plugs should be easy to reach for all occupants. Plug sockets should be raised to between 25-27 inches from the floor with light switches at 40 inches.</li>
      <li>Minimize the number of transitions between types of flooring and the use of carpet. This will decrease the number of trip hazards in the home as well as frequent replacing costly carpet. If carpet is a must, stick with a low pile and use as little as possible.</li>
      <li>Handles and faucets. Paddle, or lever, style handles are excellent replacements for door knobs. Simple pressure with a fist or an elbow will serve to open the door. Same for faucet handles in the kitchen and the bathroom. Drawer pulls should be "U" shaped to allow for a simple "hook" with stiff fingers.</li>
    </ol>

  <p><strong>It is important that to note that most spaces will need to be accessible to more than just one family member at a time. Quite often special needs individuals will have Home Health Aides, Respite Providers and other family members assisting them at various times during the day. Especially children. Everyone needs to be able to safely use all spaces within the home.</strong></p>

  <p>True Universal Home Design is building design that EVERY member of the household, regardless of ability, is able to access every square inch of the space and not be impeded in the process.</p>

<h4>Housing Options - Finding a Home to Live In</h4>
<h5>Option 1 - Renting (Subsidized):</h5>
  <p>State and federally funded accessible housing. Must be applied for. Eligible applicants are put on a waiting list and notified when housing becomes available. Waiting lists for this type of housing are 3-5 years minimum. Some of the positives - Housing is fully accessible, usually close to public transportation routes, close to shopping & other services, significantly lower (subsidized) rents.</p>

<h5>Option 2 - Renting (Private)</h5>
  <p>In some instances you may be able to find housing that, with a few simple changes, can be made accessible. Many individuals find homes with open floor plans, reasonably sized bathrooms and kitchens but needing a ramp and doorknob changes workable alternatives. Negotiate with the landlord about building either a temporary or permanent ramp. Replacing round doorknobs with a paddle handle knob will allow easy access and is of minimal expense. Changing toilet seats can also be done to enhance accessibility. Ask for permission to install grab bars in the shower. You may be able to find removable tub railings at your local home improvement center. Be creative and use your imagination. Always get permission in writing for any and all changes first. Be sure to keep a copy of this agreement with your rental agreement.</p>

<h5>Option 3 - Purchasing (Existing as Accessible)</h5>
  <p>Before you begin shopping for a new home it is helpful to get pre-qualified for your loan. Shopping for a loan can be a tedious process but a very important one. Pre-qualifying for your loan will give you your budget and the price range you and your realtor can start looking for. If you can find a home that is already accessible and will suit your needs...take it! These don't last long on the market and can be extremely difficult to find.</p>

  <p>Be sure to find a good Real Estate agent in your area who will do daily checks on the MLS for new listings and is familiar with basic accessibility needs. It is important that you have an agent you feel comfortable working with. Interview several before choosing one. You don't have to be stuck with the first agent that comes your way! You are the boss; find someone whom you are comfortable with and communicate well with. Before you even begin to look, sit down with your agent and co-ordinate a detailed list of your family's needs and the features you will need in a new home. Be prepared to be patient and persistent!</p>

<h5>Option 4 - Purchasing (Existing but Not Accessible)</h5>
  <p>This is the most common situation. You find a house that will most closely suit your needs but will require some basic remodeling to accommodate the special needs of your family. Be creative and use your imagination. With a little ingenuity, some creative financing, an affordable accessible house is within reach. Consult with an expert such as a rehabilitation specialist, building contractor, structural engineer, architect, experienced drafter, etc. As long as the basic framework needed is in place and can accommodate the modifications recommended by the expert, you can make it work. Don't be afraid to take your contractor/architect/drafter etc. along with you to look at the home itself, if need be. It is better to look at a home and find out if you can make modifications within your budget BEFORE making a purchase! Remember, the house needs to work with your needs, not create more problems.</p>

  </p>You may also need to consult with an occupational rehabilitation specialist (therapist) for some of the finer equipment details (see How Do I Know What I Need) regarding access in the bathroom, kitchen, and other areas of the house being used by the occupant. This may be as simple as door handle changes and safety railings to full structural remodels to accommodate wheelchairs and extra equipment.</p>

<h5>Option 5 - Building New</h5>
  <p>Building a new home is one way to ensure that your needs are covered but it is not a simple process and will take a great deal of time and patience to see it through. The most important thing to do if you are considering this option is to exhaustively shop around. Finding the right location with the right floor plan and the right building contractor are factors that only begin to scratch the surface of what is involved but the end results may be far more effective in accommodating the needs of your family. This, in itself, can be worth every minute of frustration waded through during the building process. Before you start down this road it is imperative to take a very serious look at your finances and the needs of your family. Do not jump into commitments without making a realistic assessment of your current situation first.</p>
