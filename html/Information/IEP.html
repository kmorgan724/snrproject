<h1>IEP Information</h1>
 
  <p>One of the most intimidating processes for a parent is the Individual Eduation Plan (IEP) meeting. This meeting should be a team effort by all persons providing services to your child with the focus being on providing a quality education.</p>

  <p>Federal law mandates that every child has equal access to a free and appropriate education regardless of physical/mental ability. This law is called the individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The sub-sections which agencies are required by law to inform you of are found below. The IDEA is far more extensive than that which is covered here. The full legal text of the 2004 Updated IDEA with simplified explanations 
  can be foudn by visiting <a href="https://www.disability.gov" target="_top">www.disability.gov</a></p>

<h2>Keeping an IEP Notebook</h2>

  <p>Preparing for your child's IEP meeting can be a challenging task. Gathering all the past IEP forms, current notification forms nursing notes, evaluation reports, grades, doctor's orders/letters, test results, classroom notes and updates, tracking forms, parent's goals etc. can add up to what sometimes seems a veritable mountain of paperwork. Keeping it all in one place and readily available is the challenge.</p>

  <p>The answer? A Parent's IEP Notebook! An updated Parent's notebook will provide a ready reference for all current IEP materials. It provides a place to organize, track and plan for current IEPs as well as assisting the parent in tracking their child's progress. It will allow the parent a ready review to assess how well the current IEP goals are working for their child and all the parent to assess when chages need to be made. Kepping an dupdated IEP notebook in an easily accessible area will provide the parent an exccellent organizational tool. Documents can be easily added and subtracted from the notebook as needed. The list could be endless! Use only that information that is pertinent to you.</p>

<h3>How to get started</h3>

  <p>Use the following items:
    <ul>
      <li>A small to medium sized 3-ring binder</li>
      <li>Lined notebook paper (use for adding notes in each section if needed)</li>
      <li>Clear page protectors</li>
      <li>Several pocket folders</li>
      <li>Tabbed dividers</li>
      <li>A red pen or fine tipped marker</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

<h4>Notebook Setup</h4>
  <p>The following information should be included in your parent notebook. Use only those categories that apply to your situation. NOt all parents are going to need all these sections. Make up only those sections that work best for you.</p>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Parent's Guide (Both Federal and School District guides) Keep a copy of each for ready reference in the front inside pocket of the binder cover.</li>
      <li>Basic History and Diagnosis. Basic information will be helpful to the educational staff assisting you in setting up the IEP.</li>
      <li>Current photo. Sometimes matching a face to the name helps staff keep the Child first and foremost in their minds. It's much easier to think in "rea" terms when you can put a face with the name.</li>
      <li>Current IEP. This is the document that is being reviewd and adjusted. For first time parents, this is the document you will need to keep handy and constantly refer to.</li>
      <li>Nursing Care Plan. For children requiring in cloassroom medical care. The parent and the shcool RN will draw up part of this document at the IEP meeting with pertinent detail handled afterwards.</li>
      <li>Doctor's Orders. Care items ordered by the child's physicialn. This section can include letters from the Dr. regarding care in the classroom, medications, therapies provided by school staff etc. Keep COPIES in the notebook and the originals in a hard file at home.</li>
      <li>Short-term goals. Goals the child's (if applicable) parents, and staff feel can be met in 3-6 months. (See "<a href="/course.html?classID=1&chapterID=5" title="Forms" alt="Forms">Forms Section</a>")"</li>
      <li>Long-term goals. Goals to be met by the end of the school year. (See "<a href="/course.html?classID=1&courseID=1&chapterID=5" title="Forms" alt+"Forms">Forms Section</a>")"</li>
      <li>Counseling. Infomrational report given by school Counseling staff.</li>
      <li>Speech Therapy. A current evaluation and recommended course of treatment.</li>
      <li>Occupational Therapy. A current evaluation and recommended course of treatment.</li>
      <li>Physical Therapy. A current evaluation and recommended course of treatment.</li>
      <li>Assistive Technologies. Equipment recommendations and procedures go here.</li>
      <li>Transportation. Any letters, medical instructions, safety instructions, specialized equipment instructions (wheelchair tie down etc.) etc to transportation staff regarding the safe transportation of your child to and from shcool while on District bussing.</li>
      <li>Extra Blank Forms and Lined Paper.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>New information and old information may be added and subtracted at any time. It is recommedned that all "old" information be placed in a filing cabinet under the dates of the school year for future reference.</p>

  <p>Remember. This is to help you, the parent, stay organized and keep all your information handy. This list could be endless! Use onle that information that is pertinent to you!</p>

<h5>Preparing for an IEP Meeting</h5>
  
  <p>Preparation is the key in making your first IEP meeting a successful one. Visit your child's classroom and be familiar with the teacher, aides, therapists, and administrators etc. who whork with your cild. Be sure to pay clase attention to staffing, levels of staff training, teacher/aide ratio per child etc. Pay specific attention to actual school facilities to make sure the building will meet your child's physical need for ramps, bathroom accessibility, etc.</p>

  <p>Consult with your child's primary care provider or pediatrician in identifying any medical cares they may need during the school day. TAlk with your child's private therapists, counselors, etc. who are familiar with your child and their individual needs regarding recommendations for goals to be met during the school day. Document all of these conversations and request letters of medical necessity from the child's physicians for medical cares to be performed whil at school</p>

  <p>Familiarize yourself with the IDEA Act focusing on the IEP setion. (It is recommended to read the education section at <a href="http://www.disabilityinfo.gov" target="_blank">www.disability.gov</a>.</p>

  <p>Obtain a copy of your School District's <u>Guide to the Individualized Education Plan</u>.  It is also recommended that you print a personal copy of the <u>Federal Guide to the Individualized Education Plan</u> to use for comparison.</p>

  <p><strong>*Note:</strong> Not all School District publications are easily read and understood. Many are abbreviated and difficult to read. Bu referencing to a copy of the Federal IEP guide, you may be able to clear up misunderstandings and clarify any problem questions that may arise during the meeting.</p>
