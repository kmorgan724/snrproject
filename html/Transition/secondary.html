<h1>Post High School Education Options</h1>
  <p>Many families assume that once their child graduates from their local School District programs there are no further educational options available for their children. Not so. Many programs are available if a parent is willing to take the time to look and then enquire.</p>

  <p>Consider some of these options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>College</strong> Many technical Colleges, traditional 2-year and 4-year colleges offer educational opportunities for students with disabilities to continue their education. Many have ancillary services such as tutoring assistance, housing, etc. for disabled students. Contact the Student Services Office at the school your student may wish to apply.</li>
      <li><strong>Vocational Training</strong> Available at schools for Applied Technology, traditional Trade Schools, and many Junior Colleges.</li>
      <li><strong>Community Continuing Education Courses</strong> Varied by community but many are available for adults of all ages and abilities through local school districts. Contact District Continuing Education offices for course listings.</li>
      <li><strong>On-The-Job Training</strong> Many high schools will begin on-the-job training as part of their regular job sampling/training curriculum.</li>
      <li><strong>Continuing Vocational Rehabilitation</strong> Vocational rehabilitation services are for those who have a physical or mental impairment that constitutes a substantial impediment to employment. Those who qualify require vocational rehabilitation services to become gainfully employed. For more information on these services contact your State Division of Rehabilitative Services.</li>

      <p>Look in your local phone book under State Government Rehabilitative (Or Vocational Rehabilitative) Services. Most offices do NOT have an e-mail address and prefer applicants and guardians contact them in person.</p>

      <li><strong>Division Supported Employment or Other Day Supports</strong> These programs vary by state and locality.</li>
      <li><strong>Supported Employment</strong> Provides job development, placement, and intensive on-the-job training in the community for adults with disabilities. According to the needs of the individual, a job coach provides supervision and supports.</li>
      <li><strong>Site and Non-Site Day Services</strong> These services are designed to promote the ongoing development and maintenance skills such as self-help skills, community living and self-sufficiency skills, social adjustment, and communication.</li>
    </ul>

  <p><strong>***Note:</strong> Not all services may be available in all areas. Check with your local or regional DSPD Office for Employment programs in your area.</p>

  <p>Use your imagination. Options for pro-active parents intent on finding an appropriate program for their child may be almost endless. Be inquisitive, do your homework and network with other parents. Your child does NOT have to sit at home watching TV or playing Video games. Help them to be as productive as they are capable of being by finding the appropriate programs for them.</p>
