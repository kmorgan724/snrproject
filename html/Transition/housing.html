    <h1>Future Housing Options</h1>

    <h2>Start to Think About Future Housing</h2>

      <p>There are many options for housing available to the individual with disabilities. It is in everyone's best interest that adequate research is done by the individual and their supports to assure the best option is chosen for them.</p>

      <p>Some of those options are:</p>

        <ul>
          
          <li><strong class="emphasis">Respite Care, In Home.</strong> Respite care is temporary care, in home, provided by a trained person for a family member with disabilities living at home. This is to relieve caregivers temporarily from the day-to-day care they provide. It can be provided in the family home, in the home of the Respite Provider or in a specialized facility, depending on the needs of the family and the individual.</li>
         
          <li><strong class="emphasis">Family Assistance and Support (Family Support)</strong> This service is a means of supporting and maintaining a family's capacity to keep a child with a disability at home. These services are flexible and might include: assistance with activities of daily living <strong class="emphasis">(ADL's)</strong>, supplemental childcare, help with therapies, assistive technology, or environmental modifications as necessary for accessibility, or activities that promote inclusion in community such as recreation and social skill building.</li>
         
          <li><strong class='emphasis'>Host Home Service</strong> An out-of-home placement for a short or extended period of time within the private home of a trained host family. This is an alternative to institutional or group home settings</li>
         
          <li><strong class='emphasis'>Supervised Group Home or Apartment</strong> Supervised living services are provided in single homes or apartments in which up to 4 individuals with disabilities may live. Services in the homes are designed to assist individuals to develop personal daily routines and activities. Homes are located in neighborhoods with access to shopping, work, and recreational activities. Typically, agencies that provide these services are required to provide 24 hour supervision of the individuals residing in the home. The amount of supervision is determined buy the needs of the individuals residing in the home.</li>
         
          <li><strong class='emphasis'>State Operated Residentail Care Facilities</strong> These programs are generally set up by the individual states to provide 24-hour residential services and supports for individuals with Developmental Disabilities. They generally have on-site medical and dental facilities intended to serve individuals who are 18 or older who have complex needs and are in need of intensive health supports or training. This is generally considered a Constrictive Environment and admission is considered <strong class="emphasis">ONLY</strong> after <strong class="emphasis">DSPD</strong> Emergency Services Management Committee has reviewed the options for least restrictive and most appropriate available alternatives.</li>
        </ul>
